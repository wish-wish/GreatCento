# Sprites/Water Distortion - Shader for Unity
Warning: this shader is a bit outdated, but it still works

This is the shader we're using in [**Beyond the Sky**](http://www.iperuraniaarts.com) for rendering water surface. It's quite easy to use:
choose a base sprite (it works with the sprite renderer component), the right sorting layer and order, select a texture for distortion
effect, scale it, set X and Y refraction values and set a scroll speed. If you donâ€™t set the scroll speed the distortion will stay still,
which is also a good way to simulate glass.

You can do whatever you want with it: you can use it in your projects, modify it, sell it, print the code and use it for making paper 
planes, you can give me credit or not.

If you take a look at [this page on the dev blog](http://iperuraniaarts.tumblr.com/post/144819410162/luna-on-water-with-free-shader-included)
you can see it in action.
