In the Shader Previews I am using a free albedo texture from [textures.com](https://www.textures.com/download/pbr0169/133204)

I cannot package it with the shader due to their ToS, so I am providing a simple texture in a similar-ish style that I made myself.

I highly recommend grabbing a better albedo texture if you are going to use the shader.
You can leave the rest as is, they should be good enough out of the box.

But feel free to customize and experiment!
